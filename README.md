# Purpose 
This is a Amazon like store fornt built using MySQL, node.js and javascript skills.
The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app will also track product sales across the store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.


# Funtionality 
The app contains 3 different views: Customer, Manager and Supervisor.

## 1) Customer view
By running Node application called `<bamazonCustomer.js>` a display of all the items available for sale will appear. This include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

The app will ask for the ID of the product they would like to buy and the number of units.

Once the purchase is made the app will provide the user witha total bill of sale. 

Note: The app will also dynamically update its database to track product sales.
